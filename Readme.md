# This is a simple Kernel which is still in progress

Hopefully it becomes a complex and powerful Kernel like Linux!


# Starting the Kernel

To start the kernel run the following command:

```
gcc kernel.c commands/ListDirectory.c commands/commands.c -o aqu_kernel
```

And then run the kernel with:

```
./aqu_kernel
```
